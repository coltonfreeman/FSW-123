Capstone Project
This is my capstone Project for FSW-123. This project contains UseState, useEffect hooks and BrowserRouter. The newest addition to my final project was connecting all the Routes through the BrowserRouter. Another error I encountered was when adding the encodeURIComponent.

3 Responsive Pages
A homepage, giphySearch, and a Jokes page.

Giphy & ListItems
